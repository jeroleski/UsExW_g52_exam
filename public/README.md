# UsExW_g52_exam

## About the project

This car sharing website was created as part of the course
'User experience og webprogrammering (Spring 2022)' at ITU.

## Running the project

The project can be opened locally by starting at 
``index.html`` 

or by visiting the firebase hosting website: 
https://sharingiscaring-bd425.web.app/

### NOTE

Please consider the following, when running the project locally:
- Please note, that running the project locally, will produce errors at the pages ``login.html`` and ``profile.html``, because they try to import Firebase libraries, that are only available online.
- The reason for inclusion in the hand-in (instead of just removing them), is that we handed in our functional working code, it is just only working as intended online.
- It is not possible to use the login features (but the error when clicking it is handled), so please use the anonymous user 'Nanna Jensen'.
